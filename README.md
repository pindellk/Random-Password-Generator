# Random-Password-Generator
JHU Boot Camp Homework 3

This is a random password generator. When the user clicks the "Generate" button, they are prompted to select whether they want 4 different elements included in their password: 
1. Lowercase letters
2. Uppercase letters
3. Numbers
4. Special characters

The user is then prompted to enter a desired character length between 8 and 128 characters. At that point a random password is generated based on the selected criteria, and displayed on the page.
